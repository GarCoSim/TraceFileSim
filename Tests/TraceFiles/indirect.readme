The purpose of this case is to ensure that it is not only the removal from the
root-set which triggers GC. This traceface creates 2 objects with the following
pointer relationship:

	rootset -> O1 -> O2

Note that the only reference to O2 is from the object O1; O2 is not a part of
the root-set. The only reference to O2 is then removed, by making O1 point at a
new object: O3. O2 is now garbage and should be collected.
