The purpose of these trace files is to concisely and explicitly create a
condition in which garbage exists. They are intended to be used as test-cases or
'sanity checks' when debugging a new GC policy.

These tracefiles can be used in conjunction with gdb to check the functionaliy
of a GC policy. The state of the heap can be visualized using the
MemoryManager::dumpHeap() method which has been added to aid in debugging. Using
gdb to explicity call forceCollect() and dumpHeap() at various points throughout
these test cases will allow you to verify the functionality of your GC policy.

Another option is to add a call to dumpHeap() after each line of the tracefile
is processed.
