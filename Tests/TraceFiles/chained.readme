The purpose of this case is to ensure that a GC collection results in chained or
cascading deletes when the parent (who is now garbage) contained the only
reference to a child. This traceface creates 2 objects with the following
pointer relationship:

	rootset -> O1 -> O2

The pointer from the root-set to O1 is then removed, leaving O1 and,
subsequently, O2 as garbage to be collected.
