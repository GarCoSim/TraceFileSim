The purpose of this case is to ensure that the GC policy can detect garbage
which contains cyclical references. Two objects are created which the following
reference relationship:

	           ->
	rootset  O1  02
	           <-

Note that although neither object is refered to by the rootset, a reference
cycle exists between the objects. A functional GC policy should detect both O1
and O2 as garbage and collect them.
